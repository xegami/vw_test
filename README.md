Cleaning robot test.

The following repo fills the needs of the task. 
I found unnecesary to add a domain structure since there are no services, repositories or controllers. Didn't want to add code just for the sake of it.
Also, I should've add some limitations under the area size of the floor since you can set the X and Y limits but robots can ignore this fact!
